Solar Power:

20 PV inverters, each rated at 110 kVA, connected to a total of 1.25 MW-peak solar panels.
The inverters are connected to an AC bus operating at 415 V, where the system load is also connected.
Battery Storage:

Battery capacity is 5.0 MWh.
The batteries are connected to a 1500 V DC bus.
This DC bus is linked to battery inverters (10 in total, each rated at 200 kVA).
The output of these inverters connects to the AC bus through a transformer that steps down from 800 V AC to 415 V AC.
Hydropower Plant:

A hydro turbine generates 1500 kW of power at 415 V, 3-phase, 50 Hz.
The turbineâ€™s output goes through a step-up transformer to 11 kV.
This 11 kV power is transmitted over 5 km of medium voltage lines to the site.
At the site, a step-down transformer connects the hydro power to the AC bus.
Utility Grid:

The national grid supplies power at 33 kV.
A step-down transformer reduces this to 415 V, connecting it to the AC bus.
Loads:

Various loads are connected to the AC bus, with a base load of 3.5 MW and peaks up to 4.2 MW.
