# Hybrid Renewable PyPSA Network Analysis

This project involves the analysis of a hybrid renewable energy network using PyPSA (Python for Power System Analysis).

## Overview

PyPSA is a Python library for simulating and optimizing power systems. This project focuses on analyzing a hybrid renewable energy network by utilizing various static network components.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains input data for the network analysis.
- `scripts/`: Includes Python scripts for data processing and analysis.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for interactive exploration and visualization.
- `results/`: Output results from the analysis.

## Getting Started
