Project Structure
=================

The project's directory structure is designed for clarity and maintainability:

- ``src/``: Contains the core source code for network setup, plotting, and analysis.
- ``data/``: Stores input data used for network analysis. This is kept separate to
  improve reproducibility and allow for easy modification of inputs.
- ``docs/``: Houses the documentation files (including this one!).
- ``results/``: A directory to store the output results from the analysis.
- ``.github/workflows/``: Configuration files for Continuous Integration/Continuous
  Deployment (CI/CD).
- ``tests/``: Contains unit and integration tests to ensure code quality and
  stability.
